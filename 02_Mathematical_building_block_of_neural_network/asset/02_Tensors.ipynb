    "- In the context of deep learning, tensors are used to represent data, such as images, sound recordings, and text, which can be processed and analyzed by machine learning algorithms. Tensors are used because they allow for efficient manipulation and processing of large amounts of numerical data.\n",

For example, a grayscale image can be represented as a **rank-2 tensor** (which we recently saw), with dimensions of width and height. A color image can be represented as a **rank-3 tensor**, with dimensions of width, height, and color channels.*\n",

    "**Axis**: An axis is a specific direction along which the elements of a tensor are arranged. In a 2D tensor (matrix), the first axis is the row axis, and the second axis is the column axis. In a 3D tensor, the first axis is often the batch axis, the second axis is the row axis, and the third axis is the column axis.\n",
