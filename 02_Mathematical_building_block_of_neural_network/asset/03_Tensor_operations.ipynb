    "## Tensor Reshaping\n",
    "Reshaping a tensor means rearanging its rows and columns to match a target shape. other words, tensor reshaping allows you to rearrange the dimensions of a tensor without changing the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use tensor reshaping in deep learning when we need to modify the shape of tensors to suit the requirements of different layers of neural networks or different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in image classification tasks, we often use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which expect input data to have a specific shape, such as (batch_size, height, width, channels). If the input images do not have this shape, we can reshape them using tensor reshaping to match the required input shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensor reshaping can also be used to flatten tensors, which is useful when we want to feed a multi-dimensional tensor as input to a dense layer. In this case, we reshape the tensor to have a shape of (batch_size, num_features), where num_features is the total number of elements in the tensor."
